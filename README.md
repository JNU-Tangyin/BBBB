# From Bias to Behavior: Modeling Market Dynamics with Bull and Bear Forces

Financial markets exhibit highly dynamic and complex behaviors driven by the interplay of historical price trends and exogenous factors, such as news, policy interpretations, and social media sentiment. The heterogeneity in these data and the diverse interpretations of investors introduce biases that complicate the modeling of market dynamics. In this study, we propose Bull-Bear Bias to Behavior (B4), which integrates temporal and contextual data to uncover the intricate relationship between market sentiment, investor behavior, and price movements. Specifically, our approach combines time-series price data with textual information, enabling a unified representation that encapsulates both the ``historical evolution of market trends'' and the ``semantic understanding of external events''. By employing a dual mechanism—Inertial Pairing to maintain temporal consistency in sample construction and Dual Competition to model the competitive dynamics between bullish and bearish forces—we effectively capture the momentum-driven interactions that influence market trends. Furthermore, a cross-attention mechanism dynamically aligns market prices with textual semantics, ensuring the model adapts to evolving market conditions. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets demonstrate that our framework not only achieves superior performance in predicting market trends but also provides interpretable insights into the interplay of biases, behaviors, and market dynamics.
